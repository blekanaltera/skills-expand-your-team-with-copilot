## Why Use These Templates?

These templates ensure that:
1. **Copilot has all the information** needed to complete the task
2. **No back-and-forth** is needed to clarify requirements
3. **Changes are implemented correctly** the first time
4. **You don't need to know technical details** - just fill in the form

## How to Create an Issue

1. Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues)
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Choose the template that best fits your need
4. Fill out all required fields
5. Submit the issue

## Tips for Writing Good Issues

- **Be specific**: Instead of "fix the colors", say "change the blue header to lime green"
- **Provide examples**: Include links, screenshots, or specific examples
- **List clear criteria**: Use checkboxes for acceptance criteria
- **Explain the why**: Help Copilot understand the context and purpose
